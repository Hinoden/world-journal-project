# Welcome to the World Journal Project

## About
I've always been fascinated with the way our lives differ from one another despite experiencing the very same day. Today, someone might be receiving their dream college acceptance letter, while another is scrambling around at work just trying to get through another hard day. Somewhere else, someone may be starting a new chapter, saying goodbye to a loved one, celebrating a milestone, or simply finding small moments of peace in the ordinary. <br />
This project aims to capture these different experiences and share them with the world. I hope in exploring this site, you'll find comfort in the diversity of human experience, and a reminder that no matter where you are in life, you're not alone.

## Purpose
Users are welcome to scroll through our collection of daily journal entries from people all around the world. It is encouraged to leave your own mark on the site by submitting your own daily journal entry, in the hopes that others can read about your day as well.

## Terms
We encourage honesty about your day! All we ask is for you to be kind and respectful in your journal entries. Any entries perpetrating harm or disrespect may be taken down.
